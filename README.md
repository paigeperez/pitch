Proposed Headline: Bronx borough the highest in highschool dropout rates city-wide

The questions you want to answer with data: Which borough has the highest highschool dropout rate? Which borough has the most economically disadvantaged students? What role does poverty play in high school dropout rates? What does that disadvantage mean for students?

Answers you have found or hypotheses as to what you think you’ll find that will backup your headline: According to NYC Open Data, the Bronx is the borough with the highest high school dropout rate at 12.72%. Brooklyn is 7.14%, Manhattan is 7.08%, Queens is 6.22%, and Staten Island is 5.05%. A reason could be poverty. I want to use vlookup to examine the “economic disadvantage” category alongside drop rates amongst the five boroughs.

Info about the data you’d like to work with:
The data was recently updated on Nov. 5, and was provided by the NYC Department of Education. The description says that the data consists of student cohorts from 2005 to 2019 and breaks down factors like gender, ethnicity, poverty, etc. But the excel sheet consists of data from 2001 to 2015. I need to reach out to the provider to better understand the years.
