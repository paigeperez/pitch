                  New York City’s uptick in graduation rates made headlines this past year amid disruptive school closures and remote learning due to COVID-19.
                </p>
                <p>But data released by the <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2005-2019-Graduation-Rates-Borough-All/ynqa-y42e"> NYC Department of Education </a> this month indicates that high school dropout rates remain an ongoing occurrence in the Bronx though the city overall is seeing a downward trend. The Bronx saw a 1% increase in 2020 and it remains the borough with the highest dropout percentage at 13%, while Manhattan and Brooklyn are at 7%, Queens at 6% and Staten Island at 5%.

                </div>
                <p>According to a recent report from <a href="https://www.advocatesforchildren.org/sites/default/files/library/nyc_student_homelessness_20-21.pdf?pt=1"> Advocates for Children of New York (AFC)</a>, an organization that collects annual data from the state’s education department on homeless children, about one in seven Bronx students experienced homelessness in the 2020-21 school year. In District 9, one out of every five students experienced homelessness.
                </p>
                <p>Nearly 28,000 students learned remotely while living in the city’s shelters last year. <a href="https://infoweb-newsbank-com.journalism.ezproxy.cuny.edu/apps/news/document-view?p=AWNB&docref=news/1862E7EDE81448D0&f=basic"> Only 52% </a> of students living in the city’s shelter graduated high school in four years, which is 27 percentage points below the citywide average graduation rate. The AFC is calling on Mayor-elect Eric Adams to take action and address the educational needs of students experiencing homelessnes.
                </p>
                <p>Some measures that made pathways for students to earn diplomas over the pandemic included reforms like the suspension of the Regents exit exams and traditional grades and the cancelation of standardized exams. <a href="https://infoweb-newsbank-com.journalism.ezproxy.cuny.edu/apps/news/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info%3Asid/infoweb.newsbank.com&svc_dat=AWNB&req_dat=2A0A3F43DE3849DCAECACFD87D0DE236&rft_val_format=info%3Aofi/fmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx&rft_dat=document_id%3Anews%252F1800B390902C4628"> According to research </a>, exit exams increase dropout rates but do not increase student achievement. Advocates for changing the requirements to graduate are pushing for other ways to show readiness besides the Regents.
                </p>
                <p> <a href="https://infoweb-newsbank-com.journalism.ezproxy.cuny.edu/apps/news/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info%3Asid/infoweb.newsbank.com&svc_dat=AWNB&req_dat=2A0A3F43DE3849DCAECACFD87D0DE236&rft_val_format=info%3Aofi/fmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx&rft_dat=document_id%3Anews%252F182BD29E6EF1A3A0"> In May</a>, Mayor Bill de Blasio was at the Bronx School for Law, Government and Justice where he laid out efforts to tackle the COVID-19 achievement gap. The “academic recovery plan”, a $500 million effort to help students catch up by assessing which of the city’s 1 million students might need more individualized tutoring, involves remote learning during after-school hours.
                </p>
                <p>Another initiative is to develop more culturally relevant material in the curriculum that is better reflective and supportive of its nearly 85% students of color. Studies have found that representative material can reduce dropout rates and boost attendance and grades. But a long road is ahead for the Bronx to meet the needs of its students as the pandemic continues to rage on and impact education.
